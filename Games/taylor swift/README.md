=====================

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by John Conway in the 70s. 
It is a zero-player game where each cell in a grid is either alive (filled) or dead (empty). 
You can determine the initial state of the grid by clicking on which cells are alive or dead. 
Then, click on the play button to see which cells live on to the next generation.

Conditions for a cell to be alive in the next generation:

1) If an alive cell and has 2 or 3 neighbors, it will live to the next generation
2) If an alive cell and has less than 2 neighbors, it will die, as if by underpopulation
3) If an alive cell and has more than 3 neighbors, it will die, as if by overpopulation
4) If a dead cell and has 3 neighbors, it will become alive, as if by reproduction
