Hello!

My name is Conrad and this is a repository of all of the projects I have worked on.
I love coding in my spare time and I decided to upload most of it to this repository. 
Some of the projects you'll find here range from very basic games (like hangman) 
to using APIs to create Neural Networks. 
Feel free to use any of the code on here.


Each of my projects is found in folders that contain a README.txt file. The README 
file will contain a description of the general theme of the folder, a brief 
description (some longer than others) of what each of the source code files do,
how to compile and run. 

I hope you enjoy and feel free to reach out to me. Thanks!


- Conrad
