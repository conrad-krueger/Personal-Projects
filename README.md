Hello!

My name is Conrad and this is a repository of all of the projects I have worked on.
I love coding in my spare time and I decided to upload most of it to this repository. 
Some of the projects you'll find here range from very basic games (like hangman) 
to creating Neural Networks. 



Each of my projects is found in folders that contain a README file. The README 
file will contain a description of the general theme of the folder, a brief 
description (some longer than others) of what each of the source code files does,
how to compile and run. 

I hope you enjoy and feel free to reach out to me. Thanks!


\- Conrad
