Hello!

My name is Conrad and this is a repository of all of the projects I have worked on.
I love coding in my spare time and I decided to upload most of it to this repository. Some of the projects you'll find here
range from very basic games (like hangman) written in python to using APIs to create Neural Networks. Feel free to use any of the code on here.


Each of my projects is found in folders that contain a README.txt file. The README file will contain a description of the general theme of the folder, a brief description (some longer than others) of what each of the source code files do, and how to compile and run. The descriptions will contain a short and a long version as I like to tell a journey of how I decided to start the project and the thought processes I had along the way to develop a solution. I want to share my view since some of these files do not produce the outcome I wanted. However, I still want to share these experiences because I have learned (and to this day, continue to learn) a lot of things on my own outside of the classroom.

I hope you enjoy and feel free to reach out to me. Thanks!
